# Changelog

All notable changes to very-ai-product-loops are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **PATCH** — fixes and wording; nothing breaks for existing users.
- **MINOR** — new capability, backward compatible.
- **MAJOR** — a breaking change; adopters must adjust their instance.

The version you pin to is the **git tag**; this file is its human-readable story.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-07-22 — One-page overview in the README

- **One-pager diagram** (`docs/onepager.html` + rendered `docs/onepager.png`): the whole
  framework on a single page — the six steps, the three living registers running through them as
  vertical rails, the working loop, the fixed-core/pluggable split, and the deliverables. Embedded
  near the top of the README.
- Docs only — no change to framework mechanics.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-21 — Single changelog

- **Single changelog:** framework files no longer carry inline `## Change log` sections —
  their history is consolidated into this file, keyed to git tags. Instance artifacts (a
  product's own step outputs, registers, sources, handoff) still keep their change logs; that
  reasoning trail is a product feature, not maintainer bookkeeping.
- `process/CONVENTIONS.md` updated accordingly: the node_type matrix now routes framework-file
  history to this changelog, while instance artifacts keep the dated-change-log convention.
- Docs only — no change to framework mechanics.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-21 — First public release

- **License:** the project is now released under the MIT license.
- **Contributing guide** and this changelog added; the README is marked released.
- No changes to the framework mechanics beyond 0.7.0 — this release opens the project
  for others to use and vendor.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-21 — Wiring hardening

- **Linter + CI:** `tools/lint.py` (dependency-free) checks wiring and enums; runs in
  GitHub Actions on every push and pull request. First run surfaced ~15 desyncs the eye
  had missed.
- **One link canon:** cross-artifact links are relative paths + `{#anchor}`; the
  `[[…]]` wiki-link machinery was removed.
- **`state.yaml`:** the cycle's position (current step, gate ticks) now lives in a
  separate `state.yaml`, apart from the human-facing `config.yaml`.
- **Enum discipline:** register `type`/`category` are single-valued, with an optional
  non-load-bearing `tags` column for cross-cutting themes.
- **Versioning contract:** real git tags, plus a `FRAMEWORK-VERSION` file written at
  install time echoing the pinned tag + commit SHA.
